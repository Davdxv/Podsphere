        "summary": "This episode was recorded on October 18th, 2021.\n\nMustafa Akyol joins me to discuss Muslim history and tradition. We touch on subjects like Jesus Christ from a Christian and Muslim perspective, the Virgin Mary's role in the Quran, separation of church and state as an ideology, the dangers of literalism when facing religious texts, and much more.\n\nMustafa Akyol is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, where he focuses on the intersection of public policy, Islam, and modernity. He's contributed as an opinion writer for the New York Times since 2013, covering politics and religion in the Muslim world.\n\nPublished by W. W. Norton, his 2011 book, \"Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty,\" presents a strong argument for Islamic liberalism. The book was long-listed for the Lionel Gelber Prize for best nonfiction book. It was also praised by The Financial Times as \"a forthright and elegant Muslim defense of freedom.\" His other books include \"Reopening Muslim Minds\" and \"The Islamic Jesus.\"\n\nFind Mustafa's most important book, \"Reopening Muslim Minds,\" here\nhttps://amazon.com/Reopening-Muslim-Minds-Freedom-Tolerance\n\nHis book \"The Islamic Jesus,\" discussed in this episode, is at\nhttps://amazon.com/Islamic-Jesus-Became-Prophet-Muslims\n\nFind a free PDF of his book \"Why, As a Muslim, I Defend Liberty\" at\nhttps://libertarianism.org/books/why-muslim-i-defend-liberty\n\nOr visit his page at the Cato Institute:\nhttps://cato.org/people/mustafa-akyol\n_____\n[00:00] Introduction\n[02:47] Regarding the separation of church and state, what do Christians and Muslims have in common?\n[10:36] What are some similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?\n[11:05] \"I see the world's history, and I see a Judeo-Christian/Islamic history because it's all Abrahamic monotheism starting at Judaism.\" Mustafa Akyol\n[11:46] What the Three Abrahamic religions have in common—monotheism, rooting in the same tradition; and strange insistence on a book as the bedrock of culture\n[12:45] Unique ideas of religious and societal tolerance through different ages in history\n[21:10] The connection Jesus and Islam\n[28:45] What is the totalitarian impulse?\n[29:30] \"I think it is an understatement of the severity of the totalitarian problem to attribute it merely to the religious.\" - Jordan Peterson\n[31:27] Critiquing the inevitable flaws of the purely secular state.

How do you determine how to conduct yourself in the world? What should you do (and is that question even genuine -- or answerable?)\nWhat inbuilt structures do you bring into the world, as a consequence of biological evolution, that help you orient yourself in life, in the face of its overwhelming complexity? What is the relationship between the games that children learn to play when becoming socialized and the cultural structures that guide us in broader society?

        "subtitle": "Canadian Politician Roman Baber joins Dr Peterson to discuss the state of the Conservative Party in Canada and their approach to climate change, and the devastating hit Canada's reputation has taken at the international level.\n\nRoman Baber is a former Member of Ontario's Provincial Parliament. He is running for Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada because he will not \"sit back while Canadians are losing faith in Canada's democracy and Canadian opportunity.\" He was removed by Doug Ford from the Ontario government caucus after calling out the collateral harm of lockdowns in January 2021. Since then, Roman has been a staunch advocate in favour of a balanced covid response and in particular against lockdowns due to their toll on the health and mental health of Canadians. Roman brought legislation to cut MPP pay to CERB levels while Emergency Orders are in place, commenced and is in litigation against the Attorney General of Ontario over Canadians' right to protest and worship outdoors and recently brought a Bill to outlaw workplace mandates. Roman is passionate about and is well familiar with justice, transit and autism policy.\n\nRoman was born and lived in the former Soviet Union until he was almost 9. He then lived in Israel until he immigrated to Canada with his family at age 15 and settled in the heart of the north Toronto district he now represents. Roman obtained a BA from York University and graduated from law school at the University of Western Ontario. During his last year of law school, Roman was a supervisor with the school's legal aid funded clinic. Roman was called to the Ontario Bar in 2006 and practiced civil and commercial litigation until his election in 2018. He served as Chair of the Ontario Provincial Parliament’s Standing Committee on Justice Policy from September 2019 until January 2021.\n\nRoman is an occasional lecturer at an after-school program, engaging high school students on constitutional and criminal law topics. He loves Canadian kindness, the Toronto Raptors and his special someone, Nancy Marchese.\n\n\n—Links— \n\nVisit Roman’s Website: Joinroman.ca\n\nFollow Roman on Twitter: @Roman_Baber\n\nMeet Roman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYipQID1t8&t=8s\n\nGoodRanchers.com/Peterson or use code: PETERSON at checkout!\nGet $30 Off + Free Shipping!\n\nExpressVPN.com/Jordan\nGet 3 Months FREE!\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL // \nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.co... \nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate \n\n// COURSES // \nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality \nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com \nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com \n\n// BOOKS // \nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order \n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-... \nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-m... \n\n// LINKS // \nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com \nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events \nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog \nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast \n\n// SOCIAL // \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson \nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson \nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #Psychology",

        "summary": "Canadian Politician Roman Baber joins Dr Peterson to discuss the state of the Conservative Party in Canada and their approach to climate change, and the devastating hit Canada's reputation has taken at the international level.\n\nRoman Baber is a former Member of Ontario's Provincial Parliament. He is running for Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada because he will not \"sit back while Canadians are losing faith in Canada's democracy and Canadian opportunity.\" He was removed by Doug Ford from the Ontario government caucus after calling out the collateral harm of lockdowns in January 2021. Since then, Roman has been a staunch advocate in favour of a balanced covid response and in particular against lockdowns due to their toll on the health and mental health of Canadians. Roman brought legislation to cut MPP pay to CERB levels while Emergency Orders are in place, commenced and is in litigation against the Attorney General of Ontario over Canadians' right to protest and worship outdoors and recently brought a Bill to outlaw workplace mandates. Roman is passionate about and is well familiar with justice, transit and autism policy.\n\nRoman was born and lived in the former Soviet Union until he was almost 9. He then lived in Israel until he immigrated to Canada with his family at age 15 and settled in the heart of the north Toronto district he now represents. Roman obtained a BA from York University and graduated from law school at the University of Western Ontario. During his last year of law school, Roman was a supervisor with the school's legal aid funded clinic. Roman was called to the Ontario Bar in 2006 and practiced civil and commercial litigation until his election in 2018. He served as Chair of the Ontario Provincial Parliament’s Standing Committee on Justice Policy from September 2019 until January 2021.\n\nRoman is an occasional lecturer at an after-school program, engaging high school students on constitutional and criminal law topics. He loves Canadian kindness, the Toronto Raptors and his special someone, Nancy Marchese.\n\n\n—Links— \n\nVisit Roman’s Website: Joinroman.ca\n\nFollow Roman on Twitter: @Roman_Baber\n\nMeet Roman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIYipQID1t8&t=8s\n\nGoodRanchers.com/Peterson or use code: PETERSON at checkout!\nGet $30 Off + Free Shipping!\n\nExpressVPN.com/Jordan\nGet 3 Months FREE!\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL // \nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.co... \nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate \n\n// COURSES // \nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality \nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com \nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com \n\n// BOOKS // \nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order \n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-... \nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-m... \n\n// LINKS // \nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com \nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events \nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog \nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast \n\n// SOCIAL // \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson \nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson \nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #Psychology",

Dr. Kagan is a wealth of information on military history, geopolitics, Putin's relationship with the USSR (which his father helped defend) and Ukrainian sovereignty, and other aspects of what’s most certainly a moment in human history that won’t be forgotten soon.\n\nFind more Dr. Frederick Kagan: https://understandingwar.org and https://criticalthreats.org\n\nFor regular updates on the situation in Ukraine: https://understandingwar.org or https://criticalthreats.org/analysis/ukraine-conflict-updates\n\nWays to help: https://linkedin.com/posts/nataliya-bugayova-97469a1a_wwwstopputinnet-activity-6903830899821985793-Z_qb\n\nAn excellent discussion of the evolution of Putin’s attitudes toward the West: https://understandingwar.org/report/how-we-got-here-russia-kremlins-worldview\n\n__________________________\nChapters\n__________________________\n[0:00] Intro\n[2:32] Current Situation\n[4:55] Motivations for Expansion\n[6:25] Russia & the West: A Brief History \n[10:47] Russian Ideology \n[18:09] The Bolshevik Revolution Today\n[21:59] History of Putin, Russia, & NATO\n[31:33] Putin in Power\n[01:00:25] Why Now? \n[01:04:30] Putin Subverts Expectations\n[01:07:30] Biden, Hybrid Warfare, & Propaganda\n[01:10:17] Putin’s Invasion: a Tactical Perspective\n[01:15:30] Ukranian Response\n[01:16:40] International Response & Russian Allies\n[01:19:00] SWIFT Ban\n[01:24:30] Protests\n[01:27:50] A Way Forward?\n[01:31:00] UnderstandingWar.org\n[01:31:50] WWIII\n[01:35:39] Repercussions of a Russian attack on NATO\n[01:38:58] Defense Budgets\n[01:39:10] Outro\n\n#Ukraine #Russia #Putin #VolodymyrZelenskyy #JordanPeterson",

That's how we should think about these things” - Dr. Ahmed\n[41:46] \"The idea that you should remove everything that could threaten someone's identity and you should make that a university-wide policy is actually, exactly the opposite of what you should do, speaking clinically if you're trying to help people become more resilient\" - Dr. Peterson\n[44:32] Microaggressions and the importance of humor\n[44:33] \"There’s no such thing as a joke that isn't a microaggression. Jokes aren't funny unless they're microaggressions–especially witty ones\" - Dr. Peterson\n[47:19] Anonymous voting & reporting\n[49:52] \"Politics is downstream from culture [and, for better or worse,] culture is generated in universities\" - Dr. Peterson\n[49:59] “What happens on campus doesn't stay on campus\" - Dr. Orr\n[50:50] \"The point about anonymous reporting is that... you can't come back to them to check their evidence. The person who has been accused can't face their accuser. There’s no possibility of due process” - Dr. Ahmed\n[54:51] Anonymous reports circumventing due process\n[57:55] Tyranny & Free Speech\n[59:17] Details about the vote; university bureaucracy\n[01:05:56] UK legislation post-Cambridge  \n[01:13:06] Anti-education & ideological purity tests at university\n[01:15:36] \"I've heard students say ‘Well, I just write what the professor wants...’ It's like no – writing is thinking and if you don't think, that becomes part of you – those words become part of you [and] that's not bad education, it's anti-education\" - Dr. Peterson",
