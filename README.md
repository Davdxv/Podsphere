# Podsphere
Podsphere is a persistent data store, a graph-visualized discovery service and a discussion platform for Podcasts, built on Arweave.

### Planned Features & Goals
Podsphere aims to flourish into a fully-decentralized (Web3) `Podcast metaverse`,  
sprouting from an ever-growing library of metadata and discussions surrounding podcasts.

Each user plays a vital role in this, by choosing which new pieces of data to contribute.  
This is achieved organically, through mere use of any of the `core features`:

- Index podcast metadata from RSS feeds and other Web2 or Web3 sources (automated, user-authorized)
- Expand ported metadata with custom user additions (Web3-hosted, Web2-compatible)
- Discover new podcasts by exploring a graph visualization, centered around your subscribed feeds
  - User-customized metadata can promote visibility of otherwise-obscured, related podcasts
- Catalogue your favorite podcast moments
  - Choose which ones to put up for public discussion and which ones to keep as private heirlooms

Our goal is not just to provide a platform uniting these features, but to provide `permanent archival of all corresponding data`.  
The `Arweave blockchain` facilitates this, conceivably for centuries to come:

- Decentralization and cryptography fortify stored data against tampering, censorship and server outages
- Being open source, the entire blockchain and its data can always survive through forking
- Moreover, each user can always download a copy of their most valued data, providing them with a local back-up, as well as an organized journal

### Current version: v0.0.7 (alpha)
Podsphere currently resides in a pre-prototype stage.
The latest version of the code can be found right here, on the [development](https://github.com/Davdxv/Podsphere/tree/development) branch.
