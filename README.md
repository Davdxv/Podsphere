# Podsphere
Podsphere is a persistent data store, a graph-visualized discovery service and a discussion platform for Podcasts, built on Arweave.

### Planned Features & Mission Statement
Podsphere aims to grow into a fully-decentralized (Web3) `Podcast metaverse` emerging from these `core features`:
- Index existing (Web2/Web3) & user-customized (Podsphere-native) podcast metadata
- Discover new podcasts using a graph visualization of their subscribed podcast feeds
- Catalogue favorite podcast moments, either as a public discussion thread or as a private heirloom

Our mission is not just to provide a platform uniting these features, but to provide `permanent archival of all corresponding data`.
The `Arweave blockchain` facilitates this, conceivably for centuries to come:

- Decentralization and cryptography fortify stored data against tampering, censorship and server outages
- Being open source, the entire blockchain and its data can always survive through forking
- Moreover, each user can always download a copy of their most valued data, providing them with a local back-up, as well as an organized journal

### Current version: v0.0.6 (alpha)
Podsphere currently resides in a pre-prototype stage.
The latest version of the code can be found right here, on the [development](https://github.com/Davdxv/Podsphere/tree/development) branch.
